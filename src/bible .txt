THIS IS NOT SOMETHING TO JOKE ABOUT
Ok Lemme explain,
In the garden of Eden when God created man,
devil(as a serpent) tempted Eve to eat of the fruit 
forbidden by God  that she wont die, instead
 have knowledge of good and evil(We all know the story...)
 when she ate eat it, she didnt die, Did God lie?(NO)
 But the death was a spiritual seperation, and man
 was cut off from the nature he had in christ, 
 God didnt come to fellowship with him anymore that was 
 the seperation(death), man had sinned and Eden was a holy place 
that God came to dwell with man and since God is a
holy God that cannot behold iniquity he sent man 
away, But after eating from the fruit of good and evil
 they eyes were open as the serpent said
and knew between good and evil so that unlocked something
in man,  WILLPOWER the power to do ANYTHING he wants to do, 
he had "FREEDOM", God sent him away but being a loving God
he  still took care of adam and his family(but the original nature
of man wasn't there anymore). 
Thats why in the Old Testament if someone sinned they 
used the blood of animals to wash away their sins but it 
wasn't Permanent, so they had to do it everytime they sinned,
God had to look for a more permenent solution for man
to rekindle that lost nature of man and bring man into
that lost relationship with God,
So he sent JESUS(who is God the son )as a man to die 
for our sins(because the wages of sin is DEATH) so due 
to that man had direct access to God and man 
was free from sin and DEATH because Jesus freed us.
So as for the devil God didnt kill him because at the 
second coming of JESUS(Rapture) the devil and all his 
demons including the people that rejected JESUS will be 
cast into the bottomless pit

CONCLUSION: I know people have questions in their hearts
unanswered and begin to doubt that God is real and all of 
that, and what has compounded the issue is that, 
When we ask those questions they tell you to keep quiet and
do not say it next time, gradually peoples heart begin
to wander and search for what seems "real" to them and 
loose sight of the one that is more real than anything 
else, But this is not the right place to ask them, look
for someone who you trust and ask, and they will explain 
them to you, or better still ask God himself, most of the 
time he is drawing you to know more about him 
don't run away, run towards him  GOD LOVES YOU üíñ
I hope this helps someone

LYRICAL HI "GOD is more real, more real than madrid üòÅ"
